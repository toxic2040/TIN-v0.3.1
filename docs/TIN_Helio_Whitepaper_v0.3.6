**Executive Summary**  
TIN delivers the first practical realization of the 25-year-old Interplanetary Internet vision: a single DTN + AI routing core instantiated across planetary nodes. Lunar TIN (v0.3.5 baseline) serves as the near-term proof-of-concept; Mars, Venus, outer-planet moons, and solar-polar outposts follow with zero protocol changes.

**1. Heritage & Founding Motivation**  
The tolerant networking foundation was created 1998–2003 at NASA JPL by Vint Cerf, Scott Burleigh, and Adrian Hooke to overcome the fundamental limitations of traditional TCP/IP in deep space—most critically, **Earth-Sun conjunction blockages** that produce weeks-long radio blackouts due to solar corona interference and line-of-sight occultation.  

Key milestones:  
- 1998–2001: IPN architectural definition (Cerf et al.)  
- 2003: DTN architecture formalization (Fall)  
- 2007: Bundle Protocol RFC 4838  

Lynn D. Harper’s concurrent NASA Ames leadership in astrobiology and low-cost lunar settlement strategy supplied the operational context these networks would ultimately support. TIN now operationalizes that vision with hybrid constellations and AI routing.

**2. Unified Architecture**  
- Core: Store-and-forward DTN + AI-driven dynamic routing (unchanged across all nodes)  
- Planetary layer: 6–8 smallsats in 400 km circular polar orbits (radius-adjusted)  
- Relay layer: One frozen-elliptical or areosynchronous hub per planet (leveraging manifested or low-cost rideshares)  
- Inter-node links: Optical or RF with bundle custody transfer  

**3. Lunar Demonstrator (v0.3.5 – locked)**  
99.9–100 % South Pole, 63–68.5 % far-side (28-day sims, elev >5°). Uses real Lunar Pathfinder ELFO as primary hub.

**4. Mars Instantiation**  
Polar smallsats + 1–2 areosynchronous relays → 99.9 %+ coverage of human landing sites and science regions, tolerant to dust storms and solar conjunctions.

**5. Broader Heliocentric Extension**  
- Venus cloud-level relays  
- Outer-planet moon constellations (e.g., Europa, Titan)  
- Solar-polar nodes for heliophysics  
- Seamless Earth–Moon–Mars–outer solar system backbone  

**6. Path Forward**  
2026–2028: Lunar flight heritage  
2028–2032: Mars node deployment  
2035+: Full solar-system mesh  

Full simulation datasets, maps, and code available. Collaboration with LSIC, NIAC, and SCaN invited.
