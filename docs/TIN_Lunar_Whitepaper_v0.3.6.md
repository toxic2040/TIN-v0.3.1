**1. Foundations & Heritage**  
TIN stands on four decades of NASA-funded tolerant networking research. The delay-tolerant core traces to the Interplanetary Internet (IPN) vision articulated by Vint Cerf and Scott Burleigh at JPL in 1998–2002 (DARPA-funded). Key milestones:  
- Cerf et al. (2001–2002) IPN architectural definition  
- Fall (2003) “A Delay-Tolerant Network Architecture for Challenged Internets”  
- RFC 4838 (2007) DTN Architecture (Cerf, Burleigh, et al.)  

Lunar relay constellation concepts matured during the Constellation program (mid-2000s NASA SCaN studies, e.g., polar + frozen-elliptical architectures). Lynn D. Harper’s pioneering work on low-cost lunar settlements and astrobiology (NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal 2000) provided essential strategic context for sustained surface operations that TIN now supports.  

TIN contributes the locked hybrid baseline (6–8 × 400 km polar + manifested Lunar Pathfinder ELFO as DTN/AI hub), AI route optimization, and explicit plug-and-play generalization—built explicitly on, and crediting, these foundations.
