Checkpoint 2: README Update
Replace the top section and add the Heritage block (exact text below – copy-paste ready):
Markdown# Tolerant Interlunar Network (TIN)

**v0.3.6** — 19 February 2026  

Hybrid Polar + Lunar Pathfinder ELFO architecture for persistent South Pole and far-side lunar coverage using DTN + AI routing. Lunar demonstrator for a generalizable solar-system tolerant network.

### Heritage & Foundations
TIN builds directly on the Interplanetary Internet (IPN) and Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) research originated at NASA JPL in 1998–2003 by Vint Cerf, Scott Burleigh, and team — explicitly designed to solve Earth-Sun conjunction radio blackouts and long/variable delays. It also draws strategic inspiration from Lynn D. Harper’s foundational NASA Ames work on low-cost lunar settlement and sustained surface operations.

### Current Baseline (locked)
- 6–8 smallsats in 400 km circular 90° polar orbits  
- Primary DTN/AI hub: real Lunar Pathfinder ELFO (frozen elliptical, perilune over South Pole)  
- 28-day simulation results (elev >5°): South Pole 99.9–100.0 %, Far Side 63.2–68.5 %  

Full materials, maps, and whitepapers in the repository. See `TIN_TechMemo_v0.3.6.pdf` for details.
Checkpoint 3: Whitepaper Files
Keep v0.3.5 versions in an /archive folder for history.
Place these as primary in root (or /docs):

TIN_TechMemo_v0.3.6.pdf
TIN_Lunar_Whitepaper_v0.3.6.md (and PDF export)
TIN_Helio_Whitepaper_v0.3.6.md (and PDF export)

Checkpoint 4: Maps/Data
No changes or new files needed. All four coverage maps and CSVs stay in TINdata/ exactly as generated. Update README references to point there (already included above).
Checkpoint 5: Release Note
Title: v0.3.6 – Documentation, Heritage & LSIC Readiness Release
Body (ready to paste):
textMajor documentation and transparency release ahead of LSIC Spring Meeting.

### What's New
- Accurate Foundations & Heritage section crediting original IPN/DTN work (Cerf/Burleigh/JPL, motivated by Earth-Sun conjunction blockages) and Lynn D. Harper’s lunar settlement strategy  
- Complete Lunar Technical Whitepaper v0.3.6  
- New Solar-System (Heliocentric) Vision Whitepaper v0.3.6  
- Updated LSIC Letter of Intent and 10-slide pitch deck outline  
- Technical Memo upgraded to v0.3.6 with full citations  

All simulation results, maps, and datasets included.  

Next milestone: LSIC LOI submission this week + April presentation slot request.  

Lunar demonstrator now fully positioned as the near-term proof-of-concept for a tolerant interplanetary network.
