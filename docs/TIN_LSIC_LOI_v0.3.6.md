**Hybrid Polar + ELFO Architecture for Artemis South-Pole Continuity and Far-Side Extension**

**Date:** 19 February 2026  
**Submitted to:** LSIC Steering Committee – Access-to-Space & Communications Working Groups  
**Contact:** J. Councilman (toxic2040), toxic2040@proton.me  
**GitHub:** https://github.com/toxic2040/TIN-v0.3.1 (v0.3.6 released today)  
**Full Package:** TIN_TechMemo_v0.3.6.pdf + Lunar/Mars/Helio Whitepapers + Pitch Deck Outline (attached or linked below)

Dear LSIC Colleagues,

Following registration today, I submit this updated Letter of Intent to offer the Tolerant Interlunar Network (TIN) v0.3.6 as an open, low-cost, immediately actionable contribution to sustained lunar surface operations.

TIN is deliberately designed as the near-term lunar demonstrator for a fully generalizable solar-system tolerant network (DTN + AI routing) applicable to Mars, Venus, outer-planet moons, and heliocentric backbones.

**Baseline Architecture (locked v0.3.6)**  
- 6–8 smallsats in 400 km circular 90° polar orbits  
- Primary DTN/AI routing hub: real Lunar Pathfinder ELFO (ESA/SSTL, frozen elliptical, perilune over South Pole, 2026 CLPS-class launch)  

**28-day simulation results (elevation >5°)**  
- South Pole coverage: 99.9 % (6 polars) → 100.0 % (8 polars)  
- Far-Side coverage: 63.2 % (6 polars) → 68.5 % (8 polars)  

These results are documented in the attached TIN_TechMemo_v0.3.6.pdf and four professional coverage maps. The architecture employs store-and-forward DTN with AI-driven route optimization, fully interoperable with SCaN and Artemis standards.

**Heritage & Transparency**  
TIN builds directly on the original Interplanetary Internet / DTN vision (1998–2007, Vint Cerf, Scott Burleigh, JPL – motivated by Earth-Sun conjunction blockages) and draws strategic inspiration from Lynn D. Harper’s foundational lunar settlement work. All credit is explicitly acknowledged in the new whitepapers.

**New in v0.3.6 (released today)**  
- Lunar Technical Whitepaper (9 pages)  
- Mars Generalization Whitepaper (5 pages)  
- Solar-System (Heliocentric) Vision Whitepaper (6 pages)  
- Updated 10-slide pitch deck outline  

**Requested Collaboration**  
1. Presentation slot (10 min + poster) at the LSIC Spring Meeting (28–30 April 2026, Washington DC / Laurel MD) in Access-to-Space or Communications.  
2. Inclusion in working-group discussions on lunar communications interoperability and Moon-to-Mars scalability.  
3. Alignment with ongoing NIAC and SCaN efforts (initial emails sent 19 Feb).

All materials, simulation datasets, and maps are available immediately on GitHub or via direct attachment. I am prepared to deliver the complete package within 48 hours of any request.

TIN’s hybrid DTN/AI core is built for plug-and-play extension beyond the Moon. Lunar implementation now will accelerate the broader solar-system tolerant network that LSIC and Artemis are enabling.

Thank you for your leadership. I look forward to contributing as a new LSIC participant.

Best regards,
J. Councilman (toxic2040)
