**Abstract**  
TIN v0.3.5 delivers near-perfect lunar south-pole coverage (99.9–100.0 %) and a major far-side performance boost (63.2–68.5 %) using a minimal, low-cost hybrid architecture: 6–8 ESPA-class smallsats in 400 km circular 90° polar orbits combined with the existing Lunar Pathfinder in its frozen elliptical orbit (ELFO: a=5740 km, e=0.58, i=55°, perilune over south pole) as the primary intelligent DTN/AI routing hub.  

28-day high-fidelity simulations (elev >5°) confirm the results. The polar constellation guarantees continuous south-pole service while ELFO perilune passes provide the critical far-side visibility boost — all built on real, already-funded assets. Combined with CCSDS DTN and AI routing, TIN enables reliable high-resilience comms for Artemis Base Camp, CLPS landers, PSR ISRU, and far-side science.

This hybrid polar + frozen-elliptical + DTN/AI approach is deliberately generalizable to Mars, Venus, outer-planet moons, and solar-polar networks.

**Relevance to LSIC & Artemis**  
Directly addresses LSIC Focus Area 4 (Communications & Navigation) and Artemis SKG-2. Provides >99.9 % south-pole availability at < $50M total mission cost (rideshare + existing Pathfinder).

**Innovation & Impact**  
• First use of real Lunar Pathfinder ELFO as active DTN/AI hub  
• True 90° polar + frozen elliptical hybrid proven in simulation  
• Open-source CLI tool + full dataset released (GitHub: https://github.com/toxic2040/TIN-v0.3.1)  
• Full technical memo (v0.3.5) with all maps attached

**Requested Next Steps**  
We seek LSIC collaboration to validate ION DTN routing, refine SWaP-C model, and explore NIAC/CLPS rideshare.

Full v0.3.5 Technical Memo and simulation repository available immediately. Happy to present at the next telecon.
