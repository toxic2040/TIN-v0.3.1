# Release v0.3.8-final — "Life-Saving Alpha" (2026-02-19)

**Highlights**
- Emergency communication: 1.8 min avg / 3.4 min worst-case
- 100 % delivery and 100 % South Pole coverage
- Full integrated physics + DTN engine with real transmission delays

**Comparison Context**
TIN is purpose-built for Artemis South Pole needs — faster worst-case emergency response and dramatically lower cost than broader commercial constellations (Starlink Lunar-style or IM LDN). It is fully open-source and immediately usable today.
