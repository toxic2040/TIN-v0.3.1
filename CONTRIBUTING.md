# Contributing to TIN

Thanks for your interest in The Interplanetary Network. This is an open proposal and all constructive input is welcome.

## Ways to Contribute

**Technical Review** — Check the orbital mechanics, link budgets, cost model, or coverage analysis. Open an issue with your findings. Data is in `data/` and methodology is in `simulations/`.

**Alternative Approaches** — Have a different relay topology, orbit selection, or architecture in mind? Open an issue to discuss it. Disagreement is valuable.

**Literature & References** — Know a relevant paper, mission study, or prior art we should cite? Drop it in an issue.

**Simulation & Modeling** — Want to replicate or extend the analysis with your own tools (STK, GMAT, etc.)? PRs with new simulation outputs are very welcome.

**Visualization** — Improvements to the interactive viz or new visual assets are appreciated.

## How to Submit

- **Feedback & Discussion:** Open an [Issue](https://github.com/toxic2040/TIN-Heliocentric-Relays/issues)
- **Content Changes:** Fork the repo, make your changes, and open a Pull Request
- **Quick Notes:** If GitHub isn't your thing, reach out on [X @toxic2040](https://x.com/toxic2040)

## Ground Rules

- Be constructive. Critique the proposal, not the person.
- Back claims with data or references where possible.
- This is an independent, unfunded proposal — expectations should be calibrated accordingly.
