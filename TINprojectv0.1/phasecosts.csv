Phase,Duration,Key Milestones,Cost Allocation (~%)
Concept/Design (Pre-Dev),6-12 months (Q3 2026 - Q2 2027),"Requirements lock-in (orbits, lasers, AI routing); partner selection (e.g., xAI for hubs, NASA/ESA input). Early simulations via GMAT/STK for trajectories.",5-10% ($125-300M) – Mostly engineering/R&D.
Development & Prototyping,2-3 years (2027-2029),"Build/test prototypes (ground lasers first, then sat buses). Qualify ion thrusters, radiation-hardened compute. AI dev for autonomous ops (e.g., handling 3-27 min delays).","50-60% ($1.25-1.8B) – Hardware, labs, simulations. Analogs: MRO dev took 3 years ~$400M/sat equivalent."
Manufacturing & Integration,"1-2 years (2028-2030, overlapping dev)","Assemble 6+ sats (spares included). Factory testing in cleanrooms; integrate payloads (10-50 cm laser telescopes, 2-3 kW arrays).",20-25% ($500-750M) – Scaling production like Starlink sats.
Launch & Deployment,6-12 months (2030-2031),"2-3 Starship launches: Cluster deploy to escape, then gravity assists (Venus for polars) or direct inserts (L-points). In-orbit commissioning (e.g., laser alignment tests).",10-15% ($250-450M) – Launches + tracking.
Operations Ramp-Up,Ongoing from year 4 (2030+),"Full 24/7 testing with Mars assets (e.g., Perseverance relays). Upgrades via software uploads. 10-year prime life.","10-15% ($250-450M initial 5 years) – Ground control, DSN time."
